\section{Conclusion}
\label{ch3-sec:conclusion}

In this paper, a graph embedding method is proposed to uncover the urban dynamics using mobility flow data. We define a flow graph to incorporate both temporal dynamics and multi-hop transitions. We also define a spatial graph to address the sparsity issue within the flow graph.  The dynamic region embeddings are jointly learned from two graphs. With three inference tasks, we demonstrate the effectiveness of our embedding method.
