\chapter{Non-Stationary Model for Crime Rate Inference Using Modern Urban Data}
\label{ch:non-stationary}

In this chapter, I focus on the third challenge in region networks modeling, i.e. how to account for spatial non-stationary property. We extend our preliminary study on crime prediction with graphically weighted regression models.
