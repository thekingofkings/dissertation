\chapter{Tackling Spatial Continuity: Task-Specific Region Partition}
\label{ch:partition}

In this chapter, I focus on the second challenge in region networks modeling, i.e. how to construct discrete nodes from continuous spatial space. We formulate our problem as an NP-hard combinatorial optimization problem.
