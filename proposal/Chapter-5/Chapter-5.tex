\chapter{Research Plan and Schedule}



The first part of improvement on the base model is already finished and under review now. Solve two proposed problems: 1) develop a dynamic spatial model and 2) develop a unified probabilistic graphical model in the next two years.
Specifically,

\textbf{Fall 2016}
\begin{itemize}
\item Work on the dynamic spatial model on top of negative binomial regression.
\item Look for other geospatial local model to compete.
\item By the end of semester have a paper ready to submit.
\end{itemize}


\textbf{Spring 2017}
\begin{itemize}
\item Submit the dynamic spatial model paper to KDD. Prepare for revision.
\item Develop a unified model starting from CRF for the crime inference.
\item Look into other urban problems to see whether the model can be easily generalized.
\end{itemize}



\textbf{Fall 2017}
\begin{itemize}
\item Evaluate the unified CRF model on crime inference problem, and hopefully another real problem.
\item Start drafting the paper.
\end{itemize}



\textbf{Spring 2018}
\begin{itemize}
\item Submit the unified model to KDD. Prepare for revision.
\item Write my thesis and prepare for final defense.
\end{itemize}
