I would like to express my special gratitude to my adviser Dr. Jessie Li, as well as my collaborator Dr. Corina Graif and Dr. Daniel Kifer, who gave me the golden opportunity to work on this interesting problem on the topic crime inference in Chicago, during which also helped me in learning new theories and developing new models. I am really thankful to them.

Lastly i would also like to thank my parents and friends who helped me a lot in finalizing this project within the limited time frame.
